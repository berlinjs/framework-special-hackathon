# Framework special hackathon

# ðŸ’¡ Idea

This is a friendly hackathon with the focus on learning and sharing. Pick any framework or compile to JS language that you wanna try out and implement the given task. It doesn't matter if you already know that technology really well or just wanna try it out. Let's learn some new stuff!

Mid-January 2018 you'll get the chance to present your project at BerlinJS, if you'd like. We would be super happy to host you, but this is entirely optional.

## ðŸ’¼ The task

- [ ] Display a list of meetups (Name, Location, Coords, Description, Time/Date, Twitter)
- [ ] List is loaded from a server*
- [ ] You can sign in*
- [ ] After signing in, you can add new entries that are saved on the server*
- [ ] Display location on Google Maps
- [ ] Click on marker highlights the meetup on the list
- [ ] Click on meetup will open up the details page

\* The server implementation can be found here: [https://github.com/berlinjs/framework-special-2018-backend](https://github.com/berlinjs/framework-special-2018-backend)

Don't worry if you don't finish the whole task, as we've said: This is entirely about learning new stuff. Also, the presentations will be in January, so there's some time left to finish if you found some joy in the project :)

**Note**: it would be ace if you'd tell us about your project so we can link to it here :) Just open up an issue or
